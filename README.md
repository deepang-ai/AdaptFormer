# Data Description

## Dataset Name: LEVIR-CD

The LEVIR-CD dataset represents a significant advancement in the field of remote sensing image change detection. Introduced by Chen et al., this dataset serves as a new benchmark for evaluating change detection algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning techniques.


### LEVIR-CD-256 Version

For our open-source model, we have worked with a modified version of the LEVIR-CD dataset, specifically tailored to a resolution of 256 Ã— 256 pixels. This adaptation, known as LEVIR-CD-256, retains the integrity of the original dataset while providing a more manageable size for certain computational models. You can find more details and access this version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18fb5jo0npu5evm/LEVIR-CD256.zip).

## Dataset Name: DSIFN-CD

The DSIFN-CD dataset is a valuable resource for the field of change detection in high-resolution bi-temporal remote sensing images. Introduced by Zhang et al., this dataset is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of image fusion networks for detecting changes over time.

### DSIFN-CD-256

In the DSIFN-CD-256 version, these images have been resized to 256 Ã— 256 pixels, providing a more compact yet equally informative dataset for change detection tasks. This modification allows for faster processing times and reduced computational requirements, making it an ideal choice for deep learning models with limited resources.You can find more details and access this version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18fb5jo0npu5evm/LEVIR-CD256.zip).
